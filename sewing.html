  <h2>Preface & Philosophy</h2><br><br>
  <p>When you hear the word "sewing", what do you think of?<br><br></p>

      <p>Sewing is often perceived as a traditional, domestic skill that is practiced by 
        women in the home. Consequently, it has been subject to misogynistic stereotypes.</p>
        <details style="display: block; padding-inline-start: 30px;">
        <summary>Some misogynistic perceptions associated with sewing include:</summary>
          <ul> 
            <li><b>Sewing as "women's work":</b> There is a deeply ingrained perception that sewing 
              is inherently a feminine activity, tied to traditional gender roles and domestic 
              duties historically assigned to women.</li>
            <li><b>Lack of value or importance:</b> Sewing and other textile crafts have often been 
              dismissed as trivial or unimportant, reflecting a broader devaluation of traditionally 
              female-dominated activities and skills.</li>
            <li><b>Lack of complexity or skill:</b> There is a misconception that sewing is a simple, 
              mindless task that requires little skill or intelligence, undermining the expertise 
              and artistry involved in many sewing and textile techniques.</li>
            <li><b>Domestic confinement: </b>Sewing has been viewed as an activity that confines women to 
              the domestic sphere, reinforcing patriarchal notions of a woman's "proper place" being 
              in the home.</li>
            <li><b>Lack of economic value:</b> The products of sewing, especially those made for personal or 
              household use, have often been undervalued or seen as having little economic worth, 
              contributing to the perception of sewing as a non-productive or non-profitable pursuit. This is 
            exacerbated by modern "fast fashion".</li></ul>
        </details>
      <p><br>However, sewing and textile engineering has revolutionized human history and is not only essential, 
        but also highly technical.<br></p>
      <details style="display: block; padding-inline-start: 30px;">
        <summary> Engineering applications include:</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Materials science and engineering: Understanding the properties, behavior, and 
            performance of different materials is crucial. This involves 
            principles of polymer science, materials chemistry, and material testing.</li>
          <li>Mechanical engineering: Sewing machines and textile machinery involve principles 
            of mechanical design, kinematics, dynamics, and vibration analysis. The interaction 
            between needle, thread, and fabric is a complex mechanical process.</li>
          <li>Structural engineering: The construction of textile products, such as clothing 
            or technical textiles, involves principles of structural design, stress analysis, 
            and load distribution to ensure durability and performance.</li>
          <li>Fluid mechanics: Principles of fluid dynamics and aerodynamics are applied in 
            the design of textile machinery, such as air-jet looms and air-laid nonwoven production processes.</li>
          <li>Tribology: The study of friction, wear, and lubrication is crucial in understanding 
            the interaction between sewing needles, threads, and fabrics, as well as the performance 
            of textile machinery components.</li>
          <li>Control systems: Modern sewing and textile machinery incorporates advanced control 
            systems, including programmable logic controllers (PLCs), computer numerical control 
            (CNC), and robotics, which require principles of control theory and systems engineering.</li>
          <li>Computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM): These tools are widely used in pattern 
            design, grading, marker making, and automated cutting processes, involving principles of 
            computer science, geometric modeling, and optimization algorithms.</li>
          <li>Textile testing and quality control: Principles of metrology, nondestructive testing, and 
            statistical process control are applied to ensure the quality and performance of textile 
            products and processes.</li>
          <li>Ergonomics and human factors: The design of sewing workstations, machinery interfaces, 
            and textile production environments involves principles of ergonomics, anthropometrics, 
            and human-machine interaction to ensure operator safety and productivity.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451929421005180">
            Bioengineering applications:</a> Textiles are highly flexible and conform to our bodies. 
            Textile science is used in varied applications from skin grafting and surgical meshes to 
            nano-scale protein engineering of fibrous polymers.</li>
          </ul>
        </details>
        <p><br>Textiles and sewing have also played a pivotal role in political movements and ideological 
          debates throughout history, often serving as symbols of power, resistance, and economic 
          systems. </p>
          <details style="display: block; padding-inline-start: 30px;">
            <summary>Prominent examples include:</summary>
            <ul>
          <li><b>Marxist theory: </b>In Das Kapital, Marx used the textile industry, particularly the cotton 
            trade and factories in England, as a prime illustration of the exploitation of workers under 
            capitalism. He analyzed in detail the harsh working conditions, long hours, and meager wages 
            endured by textile workers, arguing that these conditions were a direct result of the capitalist 
            system's drive for profit maximization at the expense of labor.
            <br>Marx's vivid descriptions of the "dark satanic mills" and the suffering of women and 
            children employed in textile factories served as a powerful indictment of the industrial 
            capitalist model. He portrayed the textile industry as a microcosm of the broader class 
            struggle between the bourgeoisie and proletariat.</li>
            <li><b>The Indian Independence movement</b>
            Mahatma Gandhi's promotion of Khadi (hand-spun and hand-woven cloth) became a symbol of 
            self-reliance and a rejection of British-imposed textile imports. The act of spinning one's
             own cloth with colorful Indian patterns was a form of peaceful cultural resistance
             against colonial rule and economic subjugation.</li>
            <li><b>American Suffrage movement:</b> Embroidered banners were a common sight at the early 
              20th century Women's Suffrage movement. The colors, patterns, and imagery used can 
              all carry specific meanings. Think of a protest group using a certain colored bandana 
              or piece of clothing to signify their affiliation.</li>
            <li><b>Recent times: </b>the global textile and apparel industry has been a focal 
            point for debates around fair labor practices, worker rights, and environmental 
            sustainability. Movements advocating for ethical and eco-friendly textiles have 
            emerged as a response to concerns over exploitative labor conditions, pollution, 
            and the industry's carbon footprint.</li>
    </ul></details>
    <p><br> Ultimately, there is no reason sewing should be seen as lesser than its traditionally 
      masculine analogue disciplines such as woodworking or metalworking, which I think is a bias 
      that is underacknowledged.<br><br>
      If you're interested, some good books on this topic include:<ul>
      <li>The Fabric of Civilization by Virginia Postrel</li> 
      <li>The Golden Thread: How Fabric Changed History by Kassia St. Clair</li>
      <li>Worn: A People's History of Clothing by Sofi Thanhauser.</li></p>

        Personal connection
      </summary>
        <span>
        When she was younger, my grandmother worked as a seamstress earning very low wages in Korea. 
        While Korea is now an economic powerhouse due to influence from the US and adoption of capitalism,
        in the not so distant past, it was wrought with poverty and greater class inequality as well
        as traditional patriarchic beliefs. My grandmother stopped going to school around her 4th grade.
        <br><br>
        When I was younger, my grandmother made sure I knew how to sew. She knew it as one of 
        the only ways women could make income, and did not have much faith in my education. As I grew 
        up and my mother and aunt began to become more successful in their careers, my grandmother 
        realized the potential of education. She now encourages me to study and tells me not to waste 
        my time sewing.
        <br><br>
        While a sewing/fashion career isn't really attractive to me, I think it is still a valuable 
        skill and I enjoy it for its utilitarian purposes as well as its potential for experimental 
        creative expression.</span>
